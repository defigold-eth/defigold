# Liquidity Pool Staking

## Total Starting Allocation for 1st pool - 15,800,000 $DGOLD

**How does this work?**&#x20;

First you will need to buy $DGOLD tokens on [**Uniswap.org**](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) **** then go to the **** [**Pools** ](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool)tab on Uniswap, connect your wallet and provide the DGOLD contract address and then submit ETH and your DGOLD tokens to the pool which will give you the UNI LP tokens in your wallet, then head over to our [**website**](https://defigold.io) and click on "Staking" and you can start staking your LP tokens. The LP tokens earn transaction fees on every DGOLD transaction through Uniswap and also will earn the APY for the staked period you chose.&#x20;
