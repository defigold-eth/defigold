# Yield "Mining" (Farming)

Yield farming in gold investments through subsidiaries such as [**The Golden Way**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT9ORoFT5I4) will bring a minimum 14% sustainable monthly revenue stream, which will be used 75% to expand the mining/yield farming and 25% for buybacks to feed future staking pools and holder rewards.

Example : $100,000 initial investment with 1 month accrual periods&#x20;

$14,000 payout every 4 weeks, $10,500 goes back to yield and $3500 goes to buy back fund for staking and holder rewards. See chart below for 5 year growth expectancy at this rate.
