# Main Goal

Mining gold within the $DGOLD system means getting rewards from every single golden venture. Miners, our investors, will receive rewards in the form of $DGOLD and/or Gold bullion on a monthly basis.

We have implemented the Proof-of-Stake method. To become a stakeholder, your wallet must contain the $DGOLD tokens. The more $DGOLD tokens you hold, the more rewards you will receive.

We have 2 types of staking available: standard token staking with 6 different accrual periods to choose from and liquidity pool staking which also has 6 different accrual periods as well. The APY earned is strong and sustainable for the project and for the investors.

We believe a strong project comes from many revenue streams to make it as long term and sustainable as possible which is why we have many different streams right from the beginning.
