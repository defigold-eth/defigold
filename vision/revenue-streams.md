# Revenue Streams

## Project Revenue Streams

1. **Yield "Mining" (Farming)**, we have been earning 14% minimum monthly revenue on our gold industry investments and yield farming so we wanted to share those profits with our investors. 75% of these earning will go to expanding the yield and physical gold mining ventures while the other 25% will go to DGOLD buybacks which will be fed into the [staking](../supporting-mechanisms/usddgold-staking.md) and periodic rewards pools.
2. **Real Gold Mining**, we are funding experienced and knowledgeable mining teams with histories of success for a share of the profits (see roadmap for timelines). We will also be setting up our mining operation with our Mining Manager (David) in Montana in the Spring of 2023 and these profits will be split 50/50, 50% going towards the expansion of mining operations and 50% going to buybacks which will be fed into the [staking](../supporting-mechanisms/usddgold-staking.md) and periodic rewards pools.
3. **Transaction Taxes** for DGOLD token:&#x20;

&#x20;         **- 5% Buy Tax & 5% Sell Tax**&#x20;

&#x20;         \- **Tax Structure:** 2% Liquidity Pool - 1% Marketing - 2% Mining/Yield

## Investor Revenue Streams

1. **Token Investment Profits,** due to our multiple revenue streams, LP staking and tokenomics, we have setup our project for continued success and a continuously rising floor
2. **Staking APY,** with our staking APY ranging from 10% all the way to 55% APY you can earn a great profit just by locking up your tokens and bringing in the yield, we have our staking pools setup so they are profitable for our holders while maintaining sustainability in the project. The staking pools do have limited spots so grab yours before it fills up.
3. **Stakers Rewards,** the holders who stake their DGOLD tokens for 6 months or more will earn passive income rewards in ETH periodically from the yield farming and gold mining profits because we believe in rewarding those who believe in us.
